# Frontend Mentor Sunnyside Agency Landing Page


Landing page for fictional company, made using react.js.

# Info

* Yes I know making a static website with React is kind of pointless, but I really wanted to try out starting a React App wite Vite instead of CRA
and to be honest I liked it alot better. There was less content that was generated for the initial build, the process to start was way faster and 
reloading to see changes was also quicker. Going forward I will exclusively be using Vite when created React apps. 10/10 will Vite again.

# Conclusion

* Pretty fun. I took a long break at the end of 2022 but I'm back now and surprisingly I didn't forget everything yahoooo.
